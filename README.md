# superchatChallenge

Hello people, thanks for having a look at my challenge.
A few things that I would like to mention:

- I didn't know what response to expect in a positive API post request, so I figured 200 should be fine, even though you get it also without the payload.
- I'm not a master of TS, still added some functionalities to show that I understand the basics.

Thanks again and get back to me any time in case of questions.
